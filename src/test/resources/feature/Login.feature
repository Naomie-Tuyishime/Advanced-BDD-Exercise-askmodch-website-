Feature: Login functionality
  As a registered customer,
  I want to log into my account using my email or username and password,
  So that I can access my personalized dashboard and services.

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid credentials
    Then I should be taken to the dashboard

  Scenario: Failed login with wrong credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter invalid password
    Then I should see the error message
    And I should see the option Lost your password? option
